# The required functionality 

As stated in the first step of this tutorial, E2E tests are great for verifying that a program does what it is supposed to do. Usually when sketching out what your application is supposed to do, you end up with a couple of high-level requirements.

High-level in the sense that it is readable and understandable by almost every human without any prior knowledge of the system or area. So in order to perform E2E tests on our beautiful TODO app, we first need to specify its requirements.

To make it simple we will have two main use cases:

1. You should be able to add TODO items by typing in the task and then pressing submit.

2. You should be able to remove items in the list by pressing a button on the item.

By having these two simple use cases we can then start implementing the  E2E tests.
