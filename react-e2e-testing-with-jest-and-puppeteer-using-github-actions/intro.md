## What you will learn:

- The importance of covering all types of testing

- Write end-to-end tests

- Automate E2E testing using GitHub Actions

- Why end-to-end testing and automating is good for DevOps

## Why is end-to-end(e2e) testing important?

End to end testing is the practice of verifying that the application under test performs as expected under near "live" settings. By performing such tests all parties involved can be confident that the application will do what it is supposed to do in production.

## The plan:

1. Introduction to testing

2. Getting to know the App

3. The required functionality

4. Testing in React

5. E2E testing with Puppeteer

6. Automation with GitHub Actions

7. Try it yourself & Take away
