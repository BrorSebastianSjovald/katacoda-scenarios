## You're ready to do it yourself..

If you’re curious and want to try this out for yourself, it’s now a great time to do so! You’re free to go to [our repo here](https://github.com/lucianozapata/react-e2e-testing) and fork the repository and implement all the previous tests we implemented together in this tutorial (perhaps you want to try and write a new test?).
When you've done so, make a pull_request and see the workflow in action!

## Take away

This are the things we wish you can take away from this tutorial:

- The importance of covering all types of testing
- How to set up testing in React
- How to create E2E tests with Puppeteer
- How to testing & CI using Github Actions

Hope you have learned a lot in this tutorial! **Good luck and happy developing!**
