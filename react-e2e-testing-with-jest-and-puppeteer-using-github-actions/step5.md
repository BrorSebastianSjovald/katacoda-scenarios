## E2E testing

It is perhaps easy to believe that because our application works purely code-wise in our local environment, that everything is peace and joy. However, a small part is missing, which is how the application works in practice, ie when a user actually uses the application. It is very possible that things may appear here that are not completely covered by previous tests.
**This is where E2E tests come in handy!**
