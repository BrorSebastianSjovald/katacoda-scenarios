# The TODO app

In this tutorial we will be testing a simple React app that handles TODO items. The app only consists of four things:

- Header
- Input field
- Submit button
- A list of TODO items

In order to run the application we first need to install all of its dependencies. We have already specified its dependencies in the `package.json` file so we can just run `npm install`{{execute}} to install the modules.

When all modules have been successfully downloaded, the app can be started by running the `npm start`{{execute}} command. We can know view the app by going to the url: https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-3000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/
